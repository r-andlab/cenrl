CenRL is a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimizing and automating censorship measurements. CenRL intelligently selects and measures potential censorship targets through sequential decision making. This design enables real-time, dynamic decision-making efficiently utilizing the limited measurement resources available and adapting to the evolving landscape of censorship. CenRL formulates the censorship measurement task as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where an intelligent entity is given the goal of optimizing censorship detection within a limited time period. CenRL provides two functionalities: (Task 1:) maximizing the discovery of blocked websites within a network and (Task 2 (dyn):) rapidly and automatically detecting changes in blocking over time within a dynamic environment. For both tasks, CenRL operates on a large input list of websites to test, such as the Tranco list of popular websites. CenRL uses several features about websites for its action space: category, subdomain, TLD, website rank, and parent entity. These features are carefully selected to capture censorship patterns. This repository provides both controlled evaluation environments (ground truths gfwatch (CHINA), russia (RUSSIA), and kazakhstan (KAZAKHSTAN)), as well as APIs for real-world censorship measurements.
